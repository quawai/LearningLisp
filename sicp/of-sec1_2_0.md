# notes on introduction of section 1.2

Procedures and the Processes They Generate


## memorandum

* The ability to visualize the consequence of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an exert programmer, just as it is in any synthetic, creative activity.  
* we must learn to visualize the processes generated by various of procedures.  

* a procedure is a pattern for the *local evolution* of a computational process,
* which specifies how each stage of process is built upon the previous stage.
* we would like to be able to make the account of *global* behaviour of a process whose local evolution has been specified by a procedure.
* In general, to describe the global behaviour is difficult,
* but we can at least try to do with some typical patterns of process evolution.  

* In this section (ยง1.2), we will examine some common "shapes" for processes generated by simple procedures.
* We will also investigate the rates at which these processes consume the important computational resources of time and space.
