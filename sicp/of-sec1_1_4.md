* the general form of Procedure Definition is `(define (<name> <formal parameters>) (<body>))`, where
	* `<name>`: a symbol to be associated with the procedure definition in the environment
	* `<formal parameters>`: the names used within the body of the procedure to refer to the corresponding arguments of the procedure
	* `<body>`: an expression that will yield the value of the procedure application when the formal parameter are replaced by the actual arguments to which the procedure is applied
