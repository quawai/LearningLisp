# LearningLisp

this repository mainly consists of two things,
my lisp codes written in order to learn Lisp 
and notes in reading SICP.

I am a beginner of Logic and CS.
Someday, I shall research Logic's and Computation,
which seem to be the different appearances of the single thing to me.

What I want to do in reading SICP is to construct Mathematics in some sense,
or to follow the history of formalization of Math by myself.
