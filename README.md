# LearningLisp

this repository mainly consists of two things,
my lisp codes written in order to learn Lisp 
and notes in reading SICP.

I am a beginner of Logic and CS.
Someday, I shall research Logic and Computation,
which seem to be the different appearances of the single thing to me.

What I want to do in reading SICP is to construct Mathematics in some sense,
or to follow the history of formalization of Math by myself.

## of codes

I put Scheme codes written for a coding practice.
There might be a simple and tiny codes.
Most of them should be components of my solutions
to the exercises in SICP.


## of SICP

I call simply SICP the book "Strcuture and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

This book is freely available here: https://github.com/sarabander/sicp

In the directly whose name is "sicp" contains
my solutions to the exercises in SICP.
