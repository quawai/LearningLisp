# LearningLisp

this repository mainly contains my lisp codes written in order to learn Lisp 
and notes in reading SICP.

I am a beginner of Logics and CS.
Someday, I shall research Logics and Computation,
which seem to be the dirrefent appearances of the single thing.

What I want to do in reading SICP is to construct Mathematics in some sense,
or to follow the history of formalization of Math by myself.
